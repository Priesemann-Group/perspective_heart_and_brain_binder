# Nonlinear Dynamics of Heart and Brain

## Explore the notebook
### Loading in binder
* To explore the executable paper, click on the Binder-link below. This will enable 
you to try the executable paper without installing an environment locally in your 
computer.
* **Note**: if you click on the binder link for the first time, the project will take 
a few minutes to load (~10 min). 
* Once the project is loaded, feel free to experiment with the model by changing both 
the notebook and the codebase, both in the notebook and in the codebase files - you 
cannot _break_ anything in the repository, worst case scenario you could have a 
negative impact on your binder version.
* To guide you through some interesting aspects of the model, there are some 
exercises at the end of each section. Feel free to take them as a starting point for 
elaborating more creative questions.



### Tips for working in the notebook
* To run a code cell, press SHIFT+ENTER
* Some code cells depend on results from code cells above them (for example cells 
provising a visualisation of the results of a simulation carried out in the above 
cells).
* You can navigate through the different sections of the notebook by using the table 
of contents at the beginning of the notebook. You can also jump back to the table of 
contents by clicking the "table of contents" link that is embedded below every 
section and figure.
