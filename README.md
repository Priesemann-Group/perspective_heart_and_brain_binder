# Nonlinear Dynamics of Heart and Brain

## Explore the notebook
### Loading in binder
* To explore the executable paper, click on the Binder-link below. This will enable 
you to try the executable paper without installing an environment locally in your 
computer.
* **Note**: if you click on the binder link for the first time, the project will take 
a few minutes to load (~10 min). 
* Once the project is loaded, feel free to experiment with the model by changing parameters or reshaping the codebase- you 
cannot _break_ anything in the repository, the changes will only affect your binder version.
* Allow some time for the silumation and the order parameter analysis tools to run: since system sizes are rather big it might take a while for the code to execute.
* To guide you through some interesting aspects of the model, there are some 
exercises at the end of each section. Feel free to take them as a starting point for 
elaborating more creative questions.



### Tips for working in the notebook
* To run a code cell, press SHIFT+ENTER
* Some code cells depend on results from code cells above them (for example cells 
provising a visualisation of the results of a simulation carried out in the above 
cells).
* You can navigate through the different sections of the notebook by using the table 
of contents at the beginning of the notebook.
