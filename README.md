# Nonlinear Dynamics of Heart and Brain
This repository provides a notebook to explore the basic concepts of nonlinear dynamics of heart and brain. It is executable in the browser, without having to install an environment locally on your 
computer.

### Organisation of the notebook
* You can navigate through the different sections of the notebook by using the table 
of contents at the beginning of the notebook.
* To guide you through some interesting aspects of the model, there are some 
exercises at the end of each section. Feel free to take them as a starting point for 
elaborating more creative questions.


### Loading in binder
* To explore the executable notebook, click on the Binder badge below. This will enable 
you to execute the code in the browser
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Priesemann-Group/perspective_heart_and_brain_binder.git/main)
* **Note**: when you open the binder link for the first time, the project will take 
a few minutes to load (~10 min). 
* Once the project is loaded, feel free to experiment with the model by changing parameters or reshaping the codebase - you 
cannot _break_ anything in the repository, the changes will only affect your personal binder instance.
* Allow some time for the simulation and the order parameter analysis tools to run: since system sizes are rather big it might take a while for the code to execute through binder. For larger or longer simulations, it is advised to clone this repository and run it locally on your computer. However, this requires to set up a python environment with the necessary requirements.


### Tips for working in the notebook
* To run a code cell, press SHIFT+ENTER.
* Some code cells depend on results from code cells above them (for example cells 
providing a visualisation of the results of a simulation carried out in the above 
cells). Thus, it is advised to run the code cells in order from top to bottom.
* It might happen that kernel dies during the execution of the notebook: in this case, close the notebook and re-open the binder link.
